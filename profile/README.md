# What is this
This space contains all the code developed for and during the live serie "*En1gma2*", streamed on the Twitch channel [*ChannelD20*](https://twitch.tv/channeld20). The content will vary from scripts in Lua for the Minecraft mod Computercraft, to for-fun programs developed in Python, games in C++ and more complex programs written in Java.

## En1gma2
*En1gma2* is one of the recurring series on **ChannelD20**, dedicated to programming and aimed to a mix between culture, nerding and entertainment. 
Hosted by Lucius, one of the founder members of the group, sometimes guests find their way in to bring their personal touch to the stream, be it in the *Coding* sections or in the *Chatting* sections.
If you found yourself here without knowing the [channel](https://twitch.tv/channeld20), go take a look at it, you will not regret it!
